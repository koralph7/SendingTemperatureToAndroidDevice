# SendingTemperatureToAndroidDevice
Java App for Sending Temperature taken from Open Weather to Android Mobile Phone.

This project is a mobile app which allow to send notifications automatically by Java server. In my example 
it's sending information about the temperature coming from OpenWeather. If T is higher than 12 it is pushing a notification.
